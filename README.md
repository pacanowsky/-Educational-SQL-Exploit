# **Educational SQL Injection Exploit Project**

This project consists of a simple **Flask web application** that is intentionally vulnerable to **SQL Injection**, and a **Python exploit script** that demonstrates how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability. The project is intended for **educational purposes only**, to provide a better understanding of security vulnerabilities, how they can be exploited, and how to defend against them.

## **Components**

### 1. **Vulnerable Web Application (`app.py`)**
   - A simple web application developed using **Flask** and **SQLite**.
   - Contains a login form that is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
   - Prints received username and password to the console.

### 2. **Exploit Script**
   - A Python script using the **Requests** library to send crafted HTTP requests to the web application.
   - Demonstrates how SQL Injection can be performed to bypass authentication.
   - Prints sent username, password, and the server response to the console.

## **Usage**

### **Running the Vulnerable Web Application**
   1. Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
   2. Install the required Python packages if you haven't already:
      ```sh
      pip install flask
      ```
   3. Run `app.py`:
      ```sh
      python app.py
      ```

### **Running the Exploit Script**
   1. In a new terminal window, navigate to the directory containing the exploit script.
   2. Install the required Python packages if you haven't already:
      ```sh
      pip install requests
      ```
   3. Run the exploit script:
      ```sh
      python exploit.py  # Replace with the actual name of your exploit script
      ```
